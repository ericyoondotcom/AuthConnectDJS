                AuthConnect is a solution for Discord bot developers to allow their users to
                link social accounts, like Google or Spotify, to their bots.<br /><br />
                AuthConnect itself does not request any of your account data and cannot
                see your Discord information, though the bot you're linking will be able
                to access the data which you have authorized to share. You can revoke
                access at any time through the provider's (Google, Spotify, etc) website.<br /><br />
                AuthConnect is not affiliated with Discord or the developer of the bot.<br /><br />
