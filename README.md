# AuthConnectDJS
Plug-and-play solution for adding Google, Spotify, etc auth to your DiscordJS projects where you access external APIs.

## Why should I use?
- 📝 **Simplifies OAuth2**: The package handles the entire OAuth2 flow for you. All you need to do is give your users a URL and use the token the library gives you.
- 🔒 **Persistent login**: Users only have to log in to your service once. AuthConnect provides built-in auth data storage solutions including local files and Firebase Firestore, or you can use your own storage solution!
- 👪 **Multiple users/guilds**: Multiple Discord users/guilds can log in to different accounts, and all data will be handled accordingly.
- 🌐 **Pre-built redirect page**: Once users sign in, they are presented with a beautiful page. The auth data is automatically beamed to your server; you don't have to make your own page or query us for the result.
- 🔄 **Automatic token refresh**: We automatically get up-to-date access tokens for you. No need to deal with refresh tokens.
- 🔢 **Supports many services**: We currently support Google and Spotify login. If you need another service, open an issue and I'll add it!
- 🔒 **Your data is safe**: Due to the way OAuth2 is built, AuthConnect cannot make API requests on your behalf and canot access your users' data, since the library cannot exchange the returned authorization code for a token without your client secret.

## AuthConnect Flow, Simplified
1. You call `generateAuthURL()` and show your users the link.
2. User authorizes your app and is redirected to our landing page, which sends the result data to your server.
3. You call `getAccessToken()`; we refresh the token if it's expired then give it to your app.
4. You call an API with your access token!

_It's that simple!_

# Get Started
See **Quickstart** for the minimum code needed to get you started!

Additionally, I've made plenty of open-source Discord bots which use this package:
- [Discord Playlist Saver](https://github.com/ericyoondotcom/discordplaylistsaver)
- [ReminderBot](https://github.com/ericyoondotcom/ReminderBot)

# Installation
[Get it from NPM.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authconnect-djs)
```bash
npm install authconnect-djs
```

# Service-specific setup

## Google Cloud
If you're using this package to interface with the Google API, follow the following steps:

1. From the Google Cloud Console, in the project you want to use, go to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.
2. Add an OAuth Client ID of type Web Application ([guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#web-application)).
3. Add the following string as an Authorized Redirect URI: `https://authconnect-djs.web.app/redir.html`. This will allow your app to redirect to our website which will beam the data to your Discord bot.
4. Note your Client ID and your Client Secret. You'll need to paste these into your code (see Quickstart).
5. From the API Library, enable whichever APIs you're going to be using.

## Spotify
1. From the Spotify Developer Console, in the project you want to use, take note of the Client ID and Client Secret. You'll need to paste these into your code (see Quickstart).
2. Click "Edit Settings", and add the following string as an Authorized Redirect URI: `https://authconnect-djs.web.app/redir.html`. This will allow your app to redirect to our website which will beam the data to your Discord bot.

# Quickstart: Example Usage for Google
```js
import AuthConnect from "authconnect-djs";
import {Client, GatewayIntentBits} from "discord.js";

const DISCORD_TOKEN = "123_your_discord_token_456";
// See section "Google Cloud setup" to learn how to get these secrets
const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "123_your_google_client_id_456";
const GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = "123_your_google_client_secret_456";

// Replace this with the scopes you want to request: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes
const SCOPES_TO_REQUEST = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube";

const bot = new Client({
    intents: [ GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages, GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent, GatewayIntentBits.DirectMessages ],
    partials: [ "CHANNEL" ]
});
let auth;

bot.login(DISCORD_TOKEN);

bot.on("ready", () => {
    auth = new AuthConnect({
        google: {
            clientId: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
            clientSecret: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
        }
    });

    // This is where your auth data will be stored on disk.
    // If you want to use Firestore or your own data storage solution, see README
    auth.useDefaultDataHandlers("./auth-data.json");
    console.log("Bot ready and AuthConnect initialized.")
});

bot.on("messageCreate", async message => {
    if(message.guild !== null && message.content === "login" && message.member.permissions.has("ADMINISTRATOR")) {
        const url = auth.generateAuthURL("google", message.guild.id, SCOPES_TO_REQUEST);
        message.channel.send("Please check your DMs for a link to log in.");
        message.member.send(`Please visit this URL to log in: ${url}`); // DM the link to the admin
    }

    if(message.guild !== null && message.content === "call an API") {
        if(await auth.isGuildLoggedIn("google", message.guild.id)) {
            const token = await auth.getAccessToken("google", message.guild.id);
            message.channel.send(`My access token is \`${token}\`!`);
            
            // You can use this token to call a Google API, such as this Youtube search endpoint:
            /*
            await fetch("https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search", {
                headers: {
                    "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`,
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                }
            });
            */
        } else {
            message.channel.send("This server is not logged in to Google. Have an administrator type `login`.");
        }
    }
});
```

# Extensibility and Avanced Usage

## Do something when a user logs in
It's often useful for a user to know when their account has been successfully linked. You can call a side effect, e.g. sending a DM to the user, by passing a callback to this function.

```js
auth = new AuthConnect({ /* ... */ });
auth.setLinkedCallback((service, guildId) => {
    console.log(`An admin for ${guildId} has logged in to ${service}.`);
});
```

## Easy local file data storage solution
If you want an easy way to store your auth data in a local file, you can simply call the function `useDefaultDataHandlers(filePath)`. See API Reference for usage.

## Easy Firebase Firestore data storage solution
If you want to store your auth data in Firebase Firestore, you can simply call the function `useFirestoreDataHandlers(firestore, collectionName)`. See API Reference for usage.

```js
// Copy the code from the Quickstart, but add the following lines:

import firebase from "firebase-admin";
// see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70106880/err-import-assertion-type-missing-for-import-of-json-file
import serviceAccount from "./path/to/firebase-admin-key.json" assert {type: "json"};

// Firebase admin SDK details here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add-sdk
firebase.initializeApp({
    credential: firebase.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
    databaseURL: "https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com"
});
const firestore = firebase.firestore();

// ... initialize discord, etc

bot.on("ready", () => {
    auth = new AuthConnect({ /* ... */ });
    auth.useFirestoreDataHandlers(firestore, "server_auth_data"); // replace "server_auth_data" with the name of the collection in which you want to store auth data
});
```

## Custom data storage solution
If none of the built-in data storage solutions work for you and you have a database set up, you can change this behavior by overriding the credential store and retrieve functions. Just call `setDataHandlers`. (Detailed in API Reference section below)

## Use an unsupported service
We currently only support Google and Spotify login. If you need another service, please open an issue, or better yet, a PR, and I'll add it!

> Coming soon: support for custom service definitions

# API Reference

## class AuthConnect

### constructor(client)
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`serviceConstants` | object (see below) | An object with your client IDs and secrets for each service.

Creates the AuthConnect object.

#### serviceConstants
The `serviceConstants` object should be in the following format:
```js
{
    google: {
        clientId: string,
        clientSecret: string
    },
    spotify: {
        clientId: string,
        clientSecret: string
    },
    /* ... */
}
```

### async isGuildLoggedIn(service, guildId): boolean
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`service` | string | The service to check (e.g. "google", "spotify").
`guildId` | string resolvable | The guild to check.

Checks if a guild has an account for a particular service associated with it.

### generateAuthURL(service, guildId, clientId, clientSecret, scope): string
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`service` | string | The service to check (e.g. "google", "spotify").
`guildId` | string resolvable | The guild to check.
`scope` | string | The scopes to request from the service. See the service's documentation for a list of scopes. This string is directly passed as a URL parameter to the service's auth URL.

Generates an authorization URL for a guild admin to visit to link their account. This URL should then be sent to the guild admin via DM.

The user will be redirected to a Yoonicode-owned website which will upload their account token to our servers.
AuthConnect will then poll our servers for data every 5 seconds for 5 minutes, at which point you should consider the URL expired and have the user request a new one.

### async getAccessToken(service, guildId): string?
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`service` | string | The service (e.g. "google", "spotify").
`guildId` | string resolvable | The guild for which to get the access token.

Gets the saved access token to use to call APIs. This function will automatically refresh the token if it has expired.

Returns `null` if no account has been linked yet. Otherwise, returns the access token.

> ⚠️ Note that for most services, you should prepend `Bearer ` to the token before you send your request.

### async getAccessTokenExpiryDate(service, guildId): Date?
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`service` | string | The service (e.g. "google", "spotify").
`guildId` | string resolvable | The guild for which to get the data.

Gets the expiry date of the saved access token.

### async getRefreshToken(service, guildId): string?
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`service` | string | The service (e.g. "google", "spotify").
`guildId` | string resolvable | The guild for which to get the data.

Gets the refresh token, if the user is logged in and one exists.

> ℹ️ Note: you should seldom need to call this method, as `getAccessToken()` automatically refreshes the token if it has expired.

### setDataHandlers(onDataGet, onDataUpdate): void
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`onDataGet` | function (see below) | A callback that should return the data for a guild.
`onDataUpdate` | function (see below) | A callback that should update the data for a guild.

Allows you to save authentication data with your own solution. Call this function right after you call the constructor.

> **Make sure you call `.bind()` on the functions you supply!**

#### async onDataGet(service, guildId): object
This function should take two parameters, `service` and `guildId`, and return a Promise that returns the guild's data for the given service (e.g. "google", "spotify"), in the following format:
```json
{
    "refreshToken": string?,
    "accessToken": string?,
    "expiryDate": Date?
}
```

#### async onDataSet(service, guildId, newData): void
This function should take three parameters, `service`, `guildId` and `newData`, and return a Promise that sets the guild's data for the given service (e.g. "google", "spotify"), which will be in the following format:
```json
{
    "refreshToken": string?,
    "accessToken": string?,
    "expiryDate": Date?
}
```

> These callbacks will be called every time token data is requested or updated, so you will want to implement some simple caching solution to avoid unnecessary database calls. You can look at the file `LocalFileDataStore` in our source code for an example.

### useDefaultDataHandlers(filePath): void
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`filePath` | string | The path of the file in which to store the data.

See "Easy local file storage solution" above.

Uses the default local file storage solution. Call this function right after you call the constructor.

### useFirestoreDataHandlers(firestore, collectionName): void
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`firestore` | string | Your instance of Firestore from the `firebase-admin` SDK.
`collectionName` | string | The name of the collection in which to store the data.

See "Easy Firebase Firestore data storage solution" above.

Uses Firebase Firestore as a data storage solution. Call this function right after you call the constructor.

### setLinkedCallback(onLinked): void
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`onLinked` | function (see below) | A function that is called whenever a user links their account.

#### async onLinked(service, guildId): void
This function takes the parameters `service` and `guildId`.
